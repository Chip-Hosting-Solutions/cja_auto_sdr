## [Unreleased]

## [3.2.2] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- New `--run-summary-json PATH` output for machine-readable run metadata across all CLI modes (supports file or stdout)
- Discovery enhancements for `--list-dataviews`, `--list-connections`, and `--list-datasets`:
  - shared `--filter`, `--exclude`, `--limit`, and `--sort` behavior
- New data view resolution mode flag `--name-match` with `exact`, `insensitive`, and `fuzzy` strategies
- Snapshot lifecycle commands:
  - `--list-snapshots` to inspect snapshot inventory from `--snapshot-dir`
  - `--prune-snapshots` to run retention-only cleanup without diff execution
- New `--quality-policy PATH` to load quality defaults from JSON (`fail_on_quality`, `quality_report`, `max_issues`) with explicit CLI flags taking precedence
- New non-interactive profile onboarding flow:
  - `--profile-import NAME FILE`
  - `--profile-overwrite` for controlled replacement of existing profiles

### Fixed
- **HTML escaping**: Replaced manual `.replace("<", "&lt;").replace(">", "&gt;")` with `html.escape()` in 3 locations (metadata values, diff tables, inventory diff tables), properly handling `&`, `"`, and `'` in addition to `<` and `>`
- **DataFrame HTML escaping**: Changed `df.to_html(escape=False)` to `escape=True` so metric/dimension values containing HTML entities are rendered safely
- **Credential file race condition**: Profile creation and import now use atomic `os.open()` with `0o600` permissions instead of `open()` followed by `chmod()`, closing the window where credentials were world-readable
- **SharedValidationCache resource leak**: Added `atexit.register(self.shutdown)` so the multiprocessing manager is cleaned up even if `shutdown()` is never called explicitly
- **Secret echo on headless systems**: Removed `getpass` fallback that silently used `input()` (echoing secrets to terminal); now prints an error and returns `False` when no TTY is available
- **Git snapshot commit safety**: `git_commit_snapshot()` now stages only snapshot paths for the targeted data view ID instead of `git add .`, preventing unrelated repository changes from being committed
- **Git init false-success path**: `git_init_snapshot_repo()` now checks and propagates `git add` / `git commit` failures instead of reporting initialization success when either command fails
- **Org-report lock liveness**: `OrgReportLock._is_process_running()` now treats `PermissionError`/EPERM as process-alive to avoid stale-lock takeover of active runs
- **Org-report lock architecture hardening**: lock coordination now routes through `cja_auto_sdr.core.locks` with `LockManager`/`LockInfo` backend orchestration (`fcntl` preferred, `lease` fallback) and optional backend override via `CJA_LOCK_BACKEND`
- **Org-report lock ownership model**: moved lock ownership semantics to backend primitives (OS advisory lock or lease ownership) instead of JSON parse state
- **Scoped lock refactor (v3.2.2 hardening)**: lock primitive state and metadata persistence are now separated (`*.lock` + atomic `*.lock.info` sidecar), preventing metadata corruption/write failures from changing lock ownership semantics
- **Typed acquisition outcomes**: backend acquisition now uses explicit outcomes (`acquired`, `contended`, `backend_unavailable`, `metadata_error`) to prevent non-contention runtime failures from being misreported as lock contention
- **Manager write-failure safety**: removed lock-path unlink cleanup from metadata write-failure handling; manager now releases backend handles without mutating ownership path state, avoiding cross-process unlink races
- **Lease unknown-probe stale recovery**: when `flock` probing is unavailable (e.g., non-`fcntl` platforms), lease acquisition now allows stale marker recovery for missing metadata instead of permanent contention lockout
- **Legacy metadata parse safety**: lock parsing now guards non-finite/out-of-range legacy timestamps and integer coercions (`pid`/`version`), preventing malformed lock payloads from crashing acquisition
- **Ownership-guarded sidecar cleanup**: lease metadata sidecar deletion now requires lock-id and inode consistency checks, preventing release/reclaim races from deleting a newly acquired owner’s metadata
- **Lease fallback race handling**: fresh unreadable lock files now use bounded retry + immediate reclamation, avoiding long stale-timeout blocks while preventing takeover during transient write windows
- **Lease fallback crash recovery**: same-host dead PID detection now reclaims stale holders immediately instead of waiting full stale timeout
- **Runtime flock compatibility fallback**: when `fcntl.flock()` is available at import time but unsupported by the target filesystem at runtime (`ENOTSUP` / `EOPNOTSUPP` / `ENOSYS`), lock acquisition now downgrades to the lease backend instead of being misreported as active contention
- **Lease heartbeat split-brain protection**: lease metadata updates are now file-descriptor-bound to the original lock inode, preventing stale holders from overwriting a newer owner’s lock metadata after reclamation
- **Cross-backend lock exclusivity**: `fcntl` acquisition now honors active non-`fcntl` lock metadata (including `lease` holders), preventing concurrent takeover when processes use different lock backends
- **Local PID stale-age protection**: same-host live PIDs no longer expire solely due age thresholds, preventing active lock takeover when timestamps become old
- **Mixed-backend open-race hardening**: `fcntl` lock acquisition now uses atomic create/open semantics and always validates pre-existing lock metadata after open, preventing `lease`/`fcntl` concurrent holders under create-time races
- **Metadata-write failure lockout prevention**: failed lock metadata writes now trigger best-effort lock-file cleanup to avoid leaving fresh unreadable artifacts that cause long false lock contention windows
- **Path-disappearance race hardening**: `fcntl` acquisition now verifies lock-path/inode identity and retries when the lock path disappears or is replaced mid-acquire, preventing handles on unlinked inodes
- **Inode-safe write-failure cleanup**: lock-file cleanup after metadata write failure now only unlinks when the path still matches the failed handle’s inode, preventing deletion of a new owner’s lock file
- **Stale unreadable fcntl lock recovery**: stale/unreadable pre-existing lock files are now reclaimed in-place by the current holder instead of looping into persistent false contention
- **Remote fcntl takeover protection in lease mode**: lease staleness checks now probe active `flock` state for remote `fcntl` owners, blocking takeover while an active remote lock is still held
- **Local fcntl-to-lease handoff correctness**: staleness checks now evaluate `fcntl` lock state before same-host PID liveness so released `fcntl` metadata from long-lived processes does not block lease acquisition indefinitely
- **Legacy lock metadata compatibility**: lock-file parsing now accepts legacy `{pid,timestamp,started_at}` payloads, preserving stale-lock recovery behavior after upgrade
- **Legacy metadata parse hardening**: malformed legacy `version` values are now safely defaulted instead of raising parsing exceptions during lock acquisition
- **Windows lease release reliability**: lease release now closes file descriptors before unlink attempts and retries path removal, preventing stuck lock files on platforms that disallow unlink of open files
- **Lease release recovery fallback**: if path unlink repeatedly fails, release writes an explicit stale tombstone marker so contenders can recover without waiting for process exit
- **Main entrypoint global side effects**: Removed global `sys.exit` monkeypatching in `main()` while preserving `--run-summary-json stdout` JSON-only output behavior
- **Retry env parsing and backoff bounds**: Invalid, negative, or non-finite `MAX_RETRIES` / `RETRY_BASE_DELAY` / `RETRY_MAX_DELAY` values now safely fall back to defaults, and invalid delay windows are clamped to prevent negative sleep durations or skipped retries
- **Batch early-stop cleanup**: Batch processor now cancels remaining futures on exception stop paths and guarantees shared-cache shutdown via `finally`
- **Org cache observability**: `OrgReportCache` now logs warnings on cache load/save failures instead of silently swallowing I/O errors
- **Snapshot diff guidance typo**: Corrected invalid remediation command shown for missing inventory snapshot data (removed nonexistent `--sdr` flag)
- **Data view cache isolation by credential context**: Data view name-resolution cache keys now include credential/profile context, preventing stale cache reuse across different profiles using the same config path
- **Org-report sample bound validation**: `--sample` now requires values of at least `1` with fast validation in both CLI argument handling and analyzer execution
- **Strict profile import validation**: Non-interactive `--profile-import` now enforces strict credential format checks and reports full validation issues before writing profile config
- **Org-report recommendation output fidelity**: Recommendation context is now normalized and preserved across HTML, Markdown, JSON, CSV, and Excel outputs, including data view pair details and non-primitive context values
- **Org-report stdout preflight validation**: Unsupported `--org-report --output -` format combinations and unknown formats are now rejected before org analysis starts, preventing expensive fail-late execution

### Changed
- Removed `.python-version` from repo; `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml` is sufficient

## [3.2.1] - 2026-02-06

### Highlights
- **Connection Discovery** - List all accessible CJA connections with their datasets using `--list-connections`
- **Dataset Discovery** - List all data views with their backing connections and datasets using `--list-datasets`
- **Permissions Fallback** - When the API service account lacks product-admin privileges, both commands gracefully fall back to deriving connection IDs from data views instead of failing
- **Mutually Exclusive Discovery** - `--list-dataviews`, `--list-connections`, and `--list-datasets` are now mutually exclusive at the CLI level
- **CI Quality Gates & Reports** - Added quality policy exits via `--fail-on-quality` and standalone issue exports via `--quality-report`
- **GitHub Step Summaries** - Added automatic Markdown summaries for diff, quality, and org-report output in GitHub Actions
- **Snapshot Auto-Prune Defaults** - Added default retention behavior for `--auto-prune` with explicit-flag precedence

### Added

#### Connection & Dataset Discovery
- New `--list-connections` flag to list all accessible connections with their datasets
- New `--list-datasets` flag to list all data views with their backing connections and dataset details
- Both commands support `--format json/csv` and `--output` for machine-readable output
- Both commands support `--profile` for multi-org credential selection
- Permissions fallback: when `GET /data/connections` returns empty (service account not a CJA Product Admin), connection IDs are derived from data view `parentDataGroupId` fields with an informative warning
- Shared `_run_list_command()` boilerplate for all discovery commands (profile resolution, CJA config, banner, error handling)
- Output routing via `_emit_output()` — handles file, stdout pipe, or console output

#### CLI Improvements
- Discovery commands (`--list-dataviews`, `--list-connections`, `--list-datasets`) are now mutually exclusive via argparse `add_mutually_exclusive_group()`

#### CI, Quality & Snapshot Controls
- Added global ANSI color controls across all output paths via `--no-color`, `NO_COLOR`, and `FORCE_COLOR`
- Added `--fail-on-quality SEVERITY` for SDR mode to return exit code `2` when quality thresholds are exceeded
- Added standalone quality issues reporting with `--quality-report json|csv` (file or stdout)
- Added automatic GitHub Actions step summaries for diff, quality, and org-report output when `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is set
- Added `--auto-prune` defaults for diff auto-snapshot flows (`--keep-last 20` + `--keep-since 30d` when retention flags are omitted)

### Fixed
- Rejected unsupported quality gate combinations: `--fail-on-quality` now errors outside SDR mode and when combined with `--skip-validation`
- Corrected quality-report failure semantics: processing failures now still exit `1` even with `--continue-on-error`, and write failures are reported as clean CLI errors instead of uncaught tracebacks
- Corrected GitHub quality summaries to include failed and successful data views in processed counts
- Corrected diff GitHub summary totals to include inventory-only changes (calculated metrics and segments)
- Corrected auto-prune retention precedence: explicit values are preserved, including `--keep-last 0`, `--keep-last=0`, `--keep-since 90d`, and `--keep-since=90d`
- Corrected empty CSV quality reports to emit a stable header row for zero-issue runs

### Testing
- Added tests for `--list-connections` table, JSON, CSV output and no-results handling
- Added tests for `--list-datasets` table, JSON, CSV output with multi-dataset connections
- Added tests for permissions fallback paths (empty connections with data view derivation)
- Added tests for mutual exclusivity of discovery commands
- Test count: 1,275

### Changed
- Updated version to 3.2.0
- **Package restructuring**: Migrated to `src/cja_auto_sdr/` layout with modular subpackages
- **Entry point**: Changed from `cja_sdr_generator:main` to `cja_auto_sdr.generator:main`
- **Dynamic versioning**: Version now read from `src/cja_auto_sdr/core/version.py`

### Dependencies
- **scipy** is an optional dependency for clustering features - install with `uv pip install 'cja-auto-sdr[clustering]'`
- New `clustering` extra for scipy dependency
- New `full` extra that bundles clustering, env, and completion extras

### Breaking Changes

**Entry Point Change**

The internal module structure has been reorganized. If you have custom integrations that import directly from the module:

```python
# Old (v3.1.0 and earlier)
from cja_sdr_generator import main

# New (v3.2.0)
from cja_auto_sdr.generator import main
# Or use the package-level import:
from cja_auto_sdr import main
```

**CLI commands are unchanged** - `cja_auto_sdr` and `cja-auto-sdr` work exactly as before.

**scipy now optional** - The `--cluster` flag requires scipy, which is no longer installed by default. Install with:
```bash
uv pip install 'cja-auto-sdr[clustering]'
```

## [3.1.0] - 2026-01-30

### Highlights
- **Segments Inventory** - Document segment filters, complexity scores, and definition summaries with `--include-segments`
- **Derived Fields Inventory** - Document derived field logic, complexity scores, and schema references with `--include-derived` (SDR only)
- **Calculated Metrics Inventory** - Document calculated metric formulas, complexity, and references with `--include-calculated`
- **Include All Inventory Shorthand** - Enable all inventory options with a single `--include-all-inventory` flag
- **Inventory Diff Support** - Track calculated metrics and segments changes over time with snapshot comparisons for the same data view
- **Inventory-Only Mode** - Generate only inventory sheets without standard SDR content with `--inventory-only`
- **Inventory Summary Mode** - Quick inventory statistics without full output with `--inventory-summary`
- **Inventory Output Ordering** - Inventory sections appear at the end of all SDR output formats, ordered by CLI argument order
- **Snapshot Inventory Support** - Include calculated metrics and segments inventory in snapshots with `--snapshot --include-calculated --include-segments`
- **Complexity Warnings at Completion** - SDR completion message now shows inventory statistics and warns about high-complexity items
- **Inventory Statistics in Metadata** - Metadata sheet includes inventory counts and complexity statistics when inventory is enabled

This release introduces **component inventory features** for SDR generation and snapshot diff comparisons. These features provide comprehensive documentation of segments, derived fields, and calculated metrics with complexity scoring for governance and review. Calculated metrics and segments inventory options work in both SDR mode and snapshot diff mode (for tracking changes to the same data view over time). Derived fields inventory is for SDR generation only since derived fields are already included in the standard metrics/dimensions output. The new `--inventory-only` flag allows generating focused inventory documentation without standard SDR sheets.

Snapshots created with `--snapshot` or `--git-commit` can now optionally include calculated metrics and segments inventory data. This enables comprehensive change tracking when comparing snapshots over time. Git snapshots store inventory in separate files (`calculated-metrics.json`, `segments.json`) for clean diffs.

> **Note:** Inventory diff is supported for calculated metrics (`--include-calculated`) and segments (`--include-segments`) for snapshot comparisons of the **same data view** only. Derived fields inventory (`--include-derived`) is for SDR generation only—derived field changes are captured in the standard Metrics/Dimensions diff. Cross-data-view comparisons (`--diff dv_A dv_B`) do not support inventory options because inventory IDs are data-view-scoped.

### Added

#### Segments Inventory (NEW)
Document all segments (filters) associated with a Data View, including definition logic, complexity scores, and component references. Supports both SDR generation and snapshot diff comparisons.

```bash
# Include segments inventory in SDR output
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments

# Combine with other inventories
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments --include-calculated --include-derived
```

**Complexity Score Factors:**
| Factor | Weight | Max |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Predicates | 30% | 50 |
| Logic operators | 20% | 20 |
| Nesting depth | 20% | 8 |
| Dimension refs | 10% | 15 |
| Metric refs | 10% | 5 |
| Regex patterns | 10% | 5 |

**New CLI Argument:**
- `--include-segments` - Include segments inventory in output (SDR and snapshot diff)

#### Derived Fields Inventory (NEW)
Document all derived fields within a Data View, including logic definitions, complexity scores, and schema field references. **For SDR generation only** (not snapshot diff, since derived fields are already included in the standard metrics/dimensions output).

```bash
# Include derived fields inventory in SDR output
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-derived
```

**Output Columns:**
| Column | Description |

**New CLI Argument:**
- `--include-calculated` - Include calculated metrics inventory in output (SDR and snapshot diff)

#### Inventory-Only Mode (NEW)
Generate output containing only inventory sheets, without standard SDR content (Metadata, Data Quality, DataView, Metrics, Dimensions).

```bash
# Generate ONLY segments inventory
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments --inventory-only

# Generate multiple inventories only
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments --include-calculated --include-derived --inventory-only

# Output in multiple formats
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments --inventory-only -f all
```

**Use Cases:**
- Focused component documentation without full SDR overhead
- Governance audits targeting specific component types
- Lightweight exports for dependency analysis
- Quick inventory snapshots for review

**New CLI Argument:**
- `--inventory-only` - Output only inventory sheets; requires at least one `--include-*` flag

#### Inventory Summary Mode (NEW)
Display quick inventory statistics without generating full output files. Shows counts, complexity distribution, governance metadata, and highlights high-complexity items that may need review.

```bash
# Quick stats for all inventories
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments --include-calculated --include-derived --inventory-summary

# Summary for segments only
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments --inventory-summary

# Save summary to JSON
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments --include-calculated --inventory-summary --format json
```

**Output includes:**
- Total counts per inventory type
- Governance stats (approved, shared, tagged counts)
- Complexity distribution (average, max, high/elevated counts)
- Container type breakdown (for segments)
- High-complexity items list (complexity >= 70) with warnings

**Example Console Output:**
```

  Tagged:      30
  Containers:  visitor: 12, visit: 18, hit: 5
  Complexity:  avg=32.1, max=78.0
  High (>=75): 2

High-Complexity Items (5):

       Case When with 12 branches...
   78 Segment            Multi-Touch Attribution
       visitor where (Page Views And...)
   ...
```

**New CLI Argument:**
- `--inventory-summary` - Display quick stats without full output; requires at least one `--include-*` flag; cannot be used with `--inventory-only`

#### Include All Inventory Shorthand (NEW)
Enable all applicable inventory options with a single flag. Automatically adjusts based on the mode.

```bash
# SDR mode: enables all three inventory options
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-all-inventory

# Equivalent to:
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-segments --include-calculated --include-derived

# With snapshots: enables only segments and calculated metrics (derived not supported)
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --snapshot ./snap.json --include-all-inventory

# Equivalent to:
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --snapshot ./snap.json --include-segments --include-calculated

# Works with other inventory modes
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-all-inventory --inventory-only
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-all-inventory --inventory-summary
```

**Smart Behavior:**
- In SDR mode: enables `--include-segments`, `--include-calculated`, and `--include-derived`
- With `--snapshot`, `--git-commit`, or snapshot diff modes: enables only `--include-segments` and `--include-calculated` (derived fields are not supported in snapshots)

**New CLI Argument:**
- `--include-all-inventory` - Enable all applicable inventory options

#### Complexity Warnings at SDR Completion (NEW)
When generating SDR with inventory options enabled, the completion message now includes inventory statistics and warns about high-complexity items.

**Example Output:**
```
SUCCESS: SDR generated for Production Analytics
  Output: ./Production_Analytics_SDR.xlsx
  Size: 2.4 MB
  Metrics: 150, Dimensions: 85
  Data Quality Issues: 12
  Inventory: Segments: 35 (2 high-complexity), Calculated Metrics: 28, Derived Fields: 42 (3 high-complexity)
  ⚠ 5 high-complexity items (≥75) - review recommended
```

This surfaces governance insights without requiring `--inventory-summary`, alerting users to potential issues at a glance.

#### Inventory Statistics in Metadata Sheet (NEW)
When inventory options are enabled, the Metadata sheet now includes inventory counts and complexity statistics.

**Additional Metadata Properties:**
| Property | Example Value |
|----------|---------------|
| --- Inventory Statistics --- | |
| Segments Count | 35 |
| Segments Complexity (Avg / Max) | 32.1 / 78.0 |
| Segments High Complexity (≥75) | 2 |
| Segments Elevated Complexity (50-74) | 5 |
| Calculated Metrics Count | 28 |
| Calculated Metrics Complexity (Avg / Max) | 28.5 / 65.0 |
| Calculated Metrics High Complexity (≥75) | 0 |
| Calculated Metrics Elevated Complexity (50-74) | 3 |
| Derived Fields Count | 42 |
| Derived Fields Breakdown | Metrics: 15, Dimensions: 27 |
| Derived Fields Complexity (Avg / Max) | 35.2 / 82.0 |
| Derived Fields High Complexity (≥75) | 3 |
| Derived Fields Elevated Complexity (50-74) | 8 |

This enables single-sheet summary for automated reporting and dashboards.

#### Inventory Diff Support (NEW)
Track changes to calculated metrics and segments over time using snapshot comparisons. This feature is limited to comparing the **same data view** across different points in time.

> **Note:** Derived fields inventory (`--include-derived`) is for SDR generation only. Derived field changes are automatically captured in the standard Metrics/Dimensions diff since they're included in the metrics/dimensions API output.

```bash
# Create snapshot with inventory data
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --snapshot ./baseline.json \
  --include-calculated --include-segments

# Compare against baseline (same data view)
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --diff-snapshot ./baseline.json \
  --include-calculated --include-segments

# Compare two snapshots directly
cja_auto_sdr --compare-snapshots ./before.json ./after.json \
  --include-calculated --include-segments

# Quick comparison against most recent snapshot
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --compare-with-prev --include-calculated
```

**Why Same Data View Only? (Design Choice)**
Calculated metrics and segments use data-view-scoped IDs that cannot be reliably matched across different data views.

**CJA Auto SDR intentionally does not attempt name-based or formula-based fuzzy matching** for calculated metrics or segments across data views. This avoids false positives where two components with the same name or similar formula actually represent different business logic. ID-based matching within the same data view over time is reliable and meaningful.

**Supported Scenarios:**
| Scenario | Inventory Diff |
|----------|----------------|
| `--diff-snapshot` (same DV) | ✓ IDs match reliably |
| `--compare-snapshots` (same DV) | ✓ IDs match reliably |
| `--compare-with-prev` (same DV) | ✓ IDs match reliably |
| `--diff dv_A dv_B` (cross-DV) | ✗ IDs cannot match meaningfully |

**Output includes:**
- Summary table with inventory change counts and percentages
- Detailed change lists for each inventory type (added/removed/modified)
- Changed field details showing before/after values
- All output formats supported: Console, JSON, Markdown, HTML, Excel, CSV

**Snapshot Version 2.0:**
Snapshots with inventory data use version 2.0 format, which includes `calculated_metrics_inventory` and `segments_inventory` arrays. Derived fields inventory is not included in snapshots—derived field changes are captured in the standard Metrics/Dimensions diff.

**Why No Derived Fields in Snapshots?**
Derived fields already appear in the Metrics/Dimensions output, so their changes are captured automatically:
- **Standard diff**: `name`, `title`, `description`, `type`, `schemaPath`
- **Extended diff** (`--extended-fields`): `hidden`, `format`, `attribution`, `persistence`, `bucketing`, `derivedFieldId`, etc.

Use `--include-derived` with SDR generation to get the full Derived Fields Inventory sheet with logic analysis, complexity scores, and schema field references.

#### Inventory Output Ordering
Inventory sections (Segments, Derived Fields, Calculated Metrics) appear at the end of all output formats in the order specified on the command line. This applies to both SDR generation and diff comparison outputs.

**Format-Specific Placement:**
| Format | Placement |
|--------|-----------|
| Excel | Additional sheets at end of workbook |
| JSON | Additional sections in output object |
| CSV | Separate `*_Segments.csv`, `*_derived_fields.csv`, `*_calculated_metrics.csv` files |
| HTML | Additional sections at end of report |
| Markdown | Additional `## Segments` / `## Derived Fields` / `## Calculated Metrics` sections |

**Excel Sheet Order (Standard SDR Mode):**
1. Metadata
2. Data Quality
3. DataView
4. Metrics
5. Dimensions
6. Segments (if `--include-segments`)
7. Derived Fields (if `--include-derived`)
8. Calculated Metrics (if `--include-calculated`)

**Excel Sheet Order (Inventory-Only Mode):**
Only inventory sheets appear, in CLI argument order.

**Note:** The order of inventory sections depends on CLI argument order:
- `--include-segments --include-derived --include-calculated` → Segments, Derived Fields, Calculated Metrics
- `--include-calculated --include-segments` → Calculated Metrics, Segments

#### Snapshot Inventory Support (NEW)
Snapshots created with `--snapshot` or `--git-commit` now support optional inclusion of calculated metrics and segments inventory data. This enables comprehensive change tracking when comparing snapshots over time.

```bash
# Create snapshot with calculated metrics inventory
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --snapshot ./baseline.json --include-calculated

# Create snapshot with segments inventory
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --snapshot ./baseline.json --include-segments

# Create snapshot with both inventories
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --snapshot ./baseline.json --include-calculated --include-segments

# Git commit with inventory data
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --git-commit --include-calculated --include-segments
```

**Git-Friendly Snapshot Structure (Extended):**
When inventory is included, Git snapshots store inventory in separate files for clean diffs:

```
sdr-snapshots/
└── ProductionAnalytics_dv_12345/
    ├── metrics.json              # All metrics, sorted by ID
    ├── dimensions.json           # All dimensions, sorted by ID
    ├── metadata.json             # Data view info, quality summary, inventory counts
    ├── calculated-metrics.json   # Optional: calculated metrics inventory
    └── segments.json             # Optional: segments inventory
```

**Snapshot Version:**
Snapshots with inventory data are automatically upgraded to version 2.0 format.

**Important: Derived Fields Not Supported in Snapshots or Snapshot Diffs**
The `--include-derived` flag is only for SDR generation mode:
- Derived fields inventory is computed from metrics/dimensions data
- Use `--include-derived` with SDR generation to output the Derived Fields sheet
- Derived field **changes** are captured in the standard Metrics/Dimensions diff (no special flag needed)

```bash
# This works: SDR generation with derived fields inventory
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-derived

# This errors: not supported with snapshots
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --snapshot ./snap.json --include-derived
# ERROR: --include-derived cannot be used with --snapshot
```

#### Derived Fields Description Support (NEW)
Derived fields now include the `description` field from data view components when available. This field appears in both DataFrame output and JSON export, maintaining consistency with calculated metrics and segments which already included descriptions from their respective APIs.

#### Additional Logic Summary Handlers (NEW)
Derived fields inventory now generates detailed logic summaries for 7 additional function types:

| Function | Summary Example |
|----------|-----------------|
| `typecast` | "Converts {field} to {target_type}" |
| `datetime-bucket` | "Buckets {field} by {interval}" |
| `datetime-slice` | "Extracts {component} from {field}" |
| `timezone-shift` | "Shifts {field} from {src_tz} to {dst_tz}" |
| `find-replace` | "Replaces {pattern} with {replacement} in {field}" |
| `depth` | "Counts depth of {field}" |
| `profile` | "References profile attribute {name}" |

#### Standardized Summary Column (NEW)
All three inventory modules now include a standardized `summary` column that aliases the module-specific summary column for cross-module queries:

| Module | Original Column | Standard Alias |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Calculated Metrics | `formula_summary` | `summary` |
| Segments | `definition_summary` | `summary` |
| Derived Fields | `logic_summary` | `summary` |

This enables consistent queries across inventory types:
```python
# Find components mentioning "revenue" across all inventories
for df in [calc_metrics_df, segments_df, derived_df]:
    matches = df[df['summary'].str.contains('revenue', case=False, na=False)]
```

### Internal Improvements

#### Inventory Code Consolidation
Refactored inventory modules to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability:

- **New shared utilities module** (`cja_inventory_utils.py`) consolidates common functionality:
  - `format_iso_date()` - Consistent date formatting across all inventories
  - `extract_owner()` - Standardized owner extraction from API responses
  - `extract_tags()` - Standardized tags extraction
  - `normalize_api_response()` - Unified DataFrame/list response handling
  - `extract_short_name()` - Consistent reference name cleaning (e.g., `metrics/revenue` → `revenue`)
  - `BatchProcessingStats` - Track processed/skipped items with visibility
  - `validate_required_id()` - Fail-fast validation for missing critical IDs

- **Improved logging visibility**:
  - Skipped items now logged at WARNING level (previously DEBUG) for better visibility
  - Batch processing summary shows processed vs. skipped counts with percentages
  - Exception logging includes full stack traces for debugging

- **Fail-fast ID validation**:
  - Calculated metrics, segments, and derived fields now validate IDs before processing
  - Missing or empty IDs are logged and skipped rather than creating invalid records

- **Enhanced console formatting**:
  - Added dim/gray text styling (`ConsoleColors.dim()`) for secondary information in inventory summary display
  - Improves visual hierarchy when displaying complexity statistics and high-complexity item details

#### Inventory Modules
- Added `SegmentSummary` dataclass for segment filter data
- Added `SegmentsInventory` class with DataFrame/JSON output
- Added `SegmentsInventoryBuilder` for parsing segment definitions via `getFilters` API
- Added `DerivedFieldSummary` dataclass for derived field data
- Added `DerivedFieldsInventory` class with DataFrame/JSON output
- Added `DerivedFieldsInventoryBuilder` for parsing field definitions
- Added `CalculatedMetricSummary` dataclass for metric data
- Added `CalculatedMetricsInventory` class with DataFrame/JSON output
- Added `CalculatedMetricsInventoryBuilder` for parsing API responses
- Added function display name constants for all inventory types (segments, derived fields, calculated metrics)
- Added `inventory_order` parameter through processing chain
- Added `inventory_only` parameter for focused inventory output
- Modified `process_single_dataview` signature for inventory support
- Modified Excel sheet writing to place inventories at end
- Added `"Segments": "🎯"` to HTML section icons
- Added validation and error messaging when inventory options are used with diff modes (`--diff`, `--diff-snapshot`, `--compare-snapshots`, `--compare-with-prev`)
- Added validation requiring `--inventory-only` to be used with at least one `--include-*` flag

#### Build Configuration
- Added inventory modules to wheel and sdist build targets to ensure proper package distribution

### API Impact
Each inventory option has different API requirements:

| Option | API Call | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `--include-segments` | `getFilters` | Additional API request |
| `--include-calculated` | `getCalculatedMetrics` | Additional API request |
| `--include-derived` | None | Parses existing data view response |

### Backwards Compatibility
- **Snapshot format v2.0** is fully backwards compatible with v1.0 snapshots
- Existing v1.0 snapshots (without inventory data) continue to work unchanged
- When loading a snapshot, the tool defaults to v1.0 if no version is specified
- v2.0 snapshots are only created when inventory data (`--include-segments` or `--include-calculated`) is included

### Upgrade Notes
- **No migration required** - existing snapshots and CI/CD pipelines work without changes
- Inventory diff features are additive; baseline snapshots without inventory data simply won't include inventory comparisons
- To track inventory changes over time, regenerate baseline snapshots with `--include-segments` or `--include-calculated`

### Dependencies
- **cjapy** minimum version bumped from `>=0.2.4.post2` to `>=0.2.4.post3`
  - Improved OAuth error handling: authentication failures now show the actual OAuth response (e.g., `invalid_client`, `invalid_scope`) instead of confusing downstream errors
  - See [Troubleshooting: OAuth Token Retrieval Failed](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#oauth-token-retrieval-failed-v310) for details

## [3.0.16] - 2026-01-24

### Highlights
- **API Worker Auto-Tuning** - Dynamically adjust API fetch workers based on response times
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Prevent cascading failures with state-based protection
- **Batch Memory Pooling** - Share validation cache across batch processing workers

This release adds three **reliability and performance optimizations** for enterprise-scale deployments. All features are opt-in via CLI flags to maintain backward compatibility.

### Added

#### API Worker Auto-Tuning
Automatically adjust API worker count based on response time metrics.

```bash
# Enable auto-tuning with default settings
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --api-auto-tune

# Custom min/max worker bounds
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --api-auto-tune --api-min-workers 2 --api-max-workers 8
```

**Features:**
- Scales up workers when responses are fast (< 200ms default)
- Scales down workers when responses are slow (> 2000ms default)
- Rolling window sampling (5 requests) before adjustments
- Cooldown period (10s) between adjustments to prevent thrashing
- Thread-safe implementation with statistics tracking

**New CLI Arguments:**
- `--api-auto-tune` - Enable automatic API worker tuning
- `--api-min-workers N` - Minimum workers for auto-tuning (default: 1)
- `--api-max-workers N` - Maximum workers for auto-tuning (default: 10)

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
Prevent cascading failures by automatically stopping requests to failing services.

```bash
# Enable circuit breaker with defaults
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --circuit-breaker

# Custom thresholds
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --circuit-breaker --circuit-failure-threshold 3 --circuit-timeout 60
```

**State Machine:**
- **CLOSED** - Normal operation, all requests allowed
- **OPEN** - Circuit tripped after failures, requests rejected immediately
- **HALF_OPEN** - Testing recovery, limited requests allowed

**Features:**
- Configurable failure threshold before opening (default: 5)
- Configurable success threshold to close (default: 2)
- Automatic timeout-based recovery (default: 30s)
- Thread-safe state transitions
- Statistics tracking (trips, rejections, failures)
- Decorator support for wrapping functions

**New CLI Arguments:**
- `--circuit-breaker` - Enable circuit breaker pattern
- `--circuit-failure-threshold N` - Failures before opening circuit (default: 5)
- `--circuit-timeout SECONDS` - Recovery timeout in seconds (default: 30)

#### Batch Memory Pooling (Shared Validation Cache)
Share validation cache across batch processing workers using multiprocessing.Manager.

```bash
# Enable shared cache in batch mode
cja_auto_sdr --batch dv_1 dv_2 dv_3 --shared-cache

# Combined with other cache settings
cja_auto_sdr --batch dv_1 dv_2 dv_3 --shared-cache --enable-cache --cache-size 2000
```

**Features:**
- Cross-process cache sharing via `multiprocessing.Manager`
- Same API as `ValidationCache` (drop-in replacement)
- LRU eviction and TTL expiration
- Process-safe locking
- Proper resource cleanup via `shutdown()` method

**New CLI Argument:**
- `--shared-cache` - Share validation cache across batch workers

## [3.0.15] - 2026-01-23

### Highlights
- **Profile Management** - Built-in support for managing multiple Adobe Organizations with `--profile`, `--profile-add`, `--profile-list`, `--profile-test`, and `--profile-show`

This release adds **multi-organization support** for agencies, consultants, and enterprises managing multiple Adobe CJA instances.

### Added

#### Profile Management for Multiple Organizations
Manage credentials for multiple Adobe Organizations without manual config file switching.

```bash
# Create profiles for your organizations
cja_auto_sdr --profile-add client-a
cja_auto_sdr --profile-add client-b

# List all profiles
cja_auto_sdr --profile-list

# Use a specific profile
cja_auto_sdr --profile client-a --list-dataviews
cja_auto_sdr -p client-b "Main Data View" --format excel

# Test profile connectivity
cja_auto_sdr --profile-test client-a

# Show profile config (secrets masked)
cja_auto_sdr --profile-show client-a

# Set default profile via environment
export CJA_PROFILE=client-a
```

**Profile directory structure:**
```
~/.cja/orgs/
├── client-a/
│   ├── config.json     # JSON credentials
│   └── .env            # Optional overrides
├── client-b/
│   └── config.json
└── internal/
    └── .env
```

**Environment variables:**
- `CJA_PROFILE` - Default profile (overridden by `--profile`)
- `CJA_HOME` - Override default `~/.cja` directory

See the [Profile Management documentation](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#profile-management) for full details.

### Testing
- **750 tests** (749 passing, 1 skipped) - up from 706 in v3.0.14
- New test file: `tests/test_profiles.py` with 43 tests covering:
  - Profile path resolution (3 tests)
  - Profile name validation (10 tests)
  - Config.json loading (4 tests)
  - .env file loading (4 tests)
  - Credential merging and precedence (5 tests)
  - Profile listing and display (6 tests)
  - Sensitive value masking (4 tests)
  - Exception hierarchy (3 tests)
  - Active profile resolution (4 tests)
- **66% code coverage** on cja_sdr_generator.py

### Internal Improvements

#### Credential Management Refactoring
Unified credential handling across profiles, environment variables, and config files:

- **Single Source of Truth**: Added `CREDENTIAL_FIELDS` constant derived from `CONFIG_SCHEMA`, eliminating 4 duplicate credential field definitions
- **Abstract Credential Loaders**: New `CredentialLoader` ABC with implementations:
  - `JsonFileCredentialLoader` - Loads from config.json files
  - `DotenvCredentialLoader` - Loads from .env files
  - `EnvironmentCredentialLoader` - Loads from environment variables
- **Unified Resolution**: `CredentialResolver` class is the single entry point for all credential loading (profile, environment, config file). The `configure_cjapy()` function uses `CredentialResolver` internally, eliminating duplicate priority logic
- **Complete Profile Integration**: All CJA-related functions now support profiles including `run_dry_run()`, `handle_snapshot_command()`, `handle_diff_command()`, and `handle_diff_snapshot_command()`
- **Standalone Profile Functions**: Profile operations (`list_profiles`, `add_profile_interactive`, `test_profile`, `show_profile`, `load_profile_credentials`) are standalone functions for simplicity
- **Standardized Validation**: `validate_credentials()` function provides consistent validation across all credential sources
- **New Exception**: `CredentialSourceError` provides detailed error context including source type and failure reason

These changes improve maintainability and make it easier to add new credential sources in the future.

- **Quick Config Status** - New `--config-status` flag shows credentials and environment without API calls
- **Accessibility Color Theme** - `--color-theme accessible` uses blue/orange instead of green/red for colorblind users
- **Snapshot Metadata Display** - Diff comparisons show file sizes, dates, and component counts
- **Interactive Data View Selection** - New `--interactive` / `-i` flag to select data views from a numbered list
- **Format Aliases** - Shortcuts for common format combinations: `reports`, `data`, `ci`
- **Performance Timings** - New `--show-timings` flag displays detailed operation timing breakdown
- **SDR Component Filtering** - Extended `--metrics-only` / `--dimensions-only` to work with SDR generation

This release focuses on **developer experience**, **accessibility**, and **usability enhancements**.

### Added

#### Format Auto-Detection from File Extension
Automatically infer output format from the `--output` file path extension.

```bash
# Format inferred from extension - no --format needed
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --output report.json   # Uses JSON format
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --output report.xlsx   # Uses Excel format
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --output report.md     # Uses Markdown format

# Explicit --format still takes precedence
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --output data.txt --format csv  # Uses CSV despite .txt extension
```

**Supported Extensions:**
- `.xlsx`, `.xls` → Excel
- `.csv` → CSV
- `.json` → JSON
- `.html`, `.htm` → HTML
- `.md`, `.markdown` → Markdown

#### Quick Config Status (`--config-status`)
Display current configuration status without making API calls.

```bash
cja_auto_sdr --config-status
```

Output shows:
- Credential source (environment variables or config file)
- Which credentials are configured (ORG_ID, CLIENT_ID, SECRET, SCOPES)
- Masked credential values for verification
- Environment details (Python version, working directory)

Useful for debugging configuration issues without waiting for API authentication.

#### Accessibility Color Theme (`--color-theme`)
Choose between color themes for diff output to accommodate colorblind users.

```bash
# Default theme (green/red/yellow)
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_1 dv_2

# Accessible theme (blue/orange/cyan)
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_1 dv_2 --color-theme accessible
```

**Available Themes:**
- `default` - Green for added, red for removed, yellow for modified
- `accessible` - Blue for added, orange for removed, cyan for modified

#### Snapshot Metadata Display
When comparing snapshots, displays file metadata for context.

```bash
cja_auto_sdr --compare-snapshots old.json new.json
```

Output includes:
- File sizes (e.g., "42.5 KB")
- Last modified dates
- Component counts (metrics and dimensions)
- Data view names and IDs

#### Interactive Data View Selection (`--interactive` / `-i`)
Interactively select data views from a numbered list instead of specifying IDs.

```bash
cja_auto_sdr --interactive
# or
cja_auto_sdr -i
```

Displays available data views with numbers, allowing selection by entering the number. Supports selecting multiple data views by entering comma-separated numbers.

#### Format Aliases
Shortcuts for common format combinations.

```bash
# Generate Excel + Markdown (documentation use case)
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --format reports

# Generate CSV + JSON (data pipeline use case)
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --format data

# Generate JSON + Markdown (CI/CD use case)
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --format ci
```

**Alias Mappings:**
- `reports` → Excel + Markdown
- `data` → CSV + JSON
- `ci` → JSON + Markdown

#### Performance Timings (`--show-timings`)
Display detailed timing breakdown for each operation.

```bash
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --show-timings
```

Shows timing for:
- API calls (getDataView, getMetrics, getDimensions)
- Data validation
- Output file generation
- Total processing time

Useful for identifying performance bottlenecks with large data views.

#### SDR Component Filtering
Extended `--metrics-only` and `--dimensions-only` flags to work with SDR generation (previously diff-only).

```bash
# Generate SDR with only metrics
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --metrics-only

# Generate SDR with only dimensions
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --dimensions-only
```

  - Format auto-detection tests (12 tests)
  - Config status flag tests (2 tests)
  - Color theme tests (9 tests)
  - Interactive flag tests (3 tests)
  - SDR component filtering tests (3 tests)
  - Format alias tests (4 tests)
  - Show timings flag tests (2 tests)

### Documentation
- Updated Quick Reference with new options
- Added format aliases and accessibility theme examples

## [3.0.13] - 2026-01-23

### Changed

#### Flexible OAuth Scopes
OAuth scope validation no longer enforces specific scope values. Scopes vary based on your Adobe Developer Console project configuration.

**Before:** The tool required specific scopes (`openid`, `AdobeID`, `additional_info.projectedProductContext`) and warned if any were missing.

**After:** The tool validates that scopes are provided but accepts any valid scopes from your Developer Console project.

```json
{
  "scopes": "your_scopes_from_developer_console"
}
```

- Copy scopes directly from Adobe Developer Console → Credentials → Scopes
- See [Adobe Authentication Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/) for details
- Updated all documentation, example configs, and error messages

## [3.0.12] - 2026-01-23

### Highlights
- **Auto-detect Workers** - Automatic optimal worker count based on CPU cores and workload
- **JSON Structured Logging** - Enterprise-ready logging for Splunk, ELK, CloudWatch
- **Config Validation Helpers** - Better error messages with actionable fix suggestions
- **Exit Code Reference** - New `--exit-codes` flag for CI/CD documentation
- **Date-based Snapshot Retention** - New `--keep-since` option for time-based cleanup
- **Unified Color Classes** - Consolidated ANSI color handling
- **Conflicting Credentials Warning** - Alerts when both env vars and config.json exist

This release focuses on developer experience, enterprise observability, and CI/CD integration enhancements.

### Added

#### JSON Structured Logging (`--log-format json`)
Enterprise-ready structured logging for log aggregation systems.

```bash
# Enable JSON logging for Splunk, ELK, CloudWatch
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --log-format json

# Output format:
# {"timestamp": "2026-01-23T15:11:50", "level": "INFO", "logger": "cja_sdr_generator", "message": "Processing data view", "module": "cja_sdr_generator", "function": "process_single_dataview", "line": 6683}
```

- **Splunk/ELK/CloudWatch Compatible**: Each log line is valid JSON
- **Structured Fields**: timestamp, level, logger, message, module, function, line
- **Exception Support**: Stack traces included in `exception` field when errors occur
- **Default**: `text` format unchanged for human-readable output

#### Auto-detect Workers (`--workers auto`)
Automatically determines optimal parallel worker count based on system resources.

```bash
# Now the default - workers auto-detected based on CPU cores
cja_auto_sdr --batch dv_1 dv_2 dv_3

# Shows: "Auto-detected workers: 4 (based on 8 CPU cores, 3 data views)"
```

- **Smart Detection**: Uses CPU core count and data view complexity
- **Memory Aware**: Reduces workers for large data views (>5000 components)
- **Explicit Override**: Still supports `--workers N` for manual control

#### Exit Code Reference (`--exit-codes`)
New flag to display detailed exit code documentation for CI/CD integration.

```bash
cja_auto_sdr --exit-codes
```

Output includes:
- Exit code meanings (0=success, 1=error, 2=changes found, 3=threshold exceeded)
- CI/CD integration examples
- Usage patterns for automation scripts

#### Date-based Snapshot Retention (`--keep-since`)
Delete snapshots older than a specified time period.

```bash
# Keep only snapshots from the last 7 days
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_A dv_B --auto-snapshot --keep-since 7d

# Keep snapshots from last 2 weeks
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_A dv_B --auto-snapshot --keep-since 2w

# Keep snapshots from last month
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_A dv_B --auto-snapshot --keep-since 1m
```

- **Flexible Formats**: `7d` (days), `2w` (weeks), `1m` (months), or plain number
- **Combinable**: Use with `--keep-last N` for both count and time-based retention
- **Compliance Friendly**: Better data governance for audit trails

#### Config Validation Helpers (`ConfigValidator` class)
Enhanced validation with actionable error messages.

**ORG_ID Validation:**
```
ORG_ID '123ABC' is missing '@AdobeOrg' suffix. Correct format: '123ABC@AdobeOrg'
```

**Scopes Validation:**
```
SCOPES cannot be empty - copy from Adobe Developer Console
```

- `ConfigValidator.validate_org_id()` - Detects missing `@AdobeOrg` suffix
- `ConfigValidator.validate_scopes()` - Validates scopes are provided (see v3.0.13 for flexible scopes)
- `ConfigValidator.validate_client_id()` - Format validation
- `ConfigValidator.validate_secret()` - Length validation

#### Conflicting Credentials Warning
Alerts users when both environment variables AND config.json exist.

```
NOTICE: Both environment variables AND config file detected
  Environment variables: ORG_ID, CLIENT_ID, SECRET, etc.
  Config file: config.json
  Using: ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (takes precedence)

To avoid confusion:
  - Remove config.json if using environment variables
  - Or unset env vars: unset ORG_ID CLIENT_ID SECRET SCOPES
```

### Changed

#### Unified Color Classes
- Enhanced `ConsoleColors` with all features from `ANSIColors`
- `ANSIColors` now delegates to `ConsoleColors` to avoid code duplication
- Added `visible_len()`, `rjust()`, `ljust()` utility methods
- Better Windows terminal compatibility

#### Workers Default
- Default changed from `4` to `auto` for automatic detection
- Existing `--workers N` syntax still works for explicit control

#### Improved Debug Logging for File Operations
- `open_file_in_default_app()` now logs failures with `logger.debug()` instead of silently swallowing exceptions
- Helps troubleshoot `--open` flag issues on different platforms

#### Enhanced Help Text
- Improved `--workers` help text explaining auto-detection behavior
- Added `--workers auto` example showing intelligent worker detection
- Added JSON logging example in help epilog

### Fixed
- Fixed `--workers` default documented as `4` instead of `auto` in CLI_REFERENCE.md

### Tests
- **671 tests passing** (up from 643 in v3.0.11)
- New tests for `ConfigValidator` class
- New tests for `auto_detect_workers()` function
- New tests for `parse_retention_period()` function

Components: 145 metrics, 287 dimensions

Quality:
  HIGH: 1
  MEDIUM: 2

Generated by CJA SDR Generator v3.0.11
```

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Initialize Git repository (one-time setup)
cja_auto_sdr --git-init --git-dir ./sdr-snapshots

# Generate SDR and commit to Git
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --git-commit

# Generate with custom commit message
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --git-commit --git-message "Pre-release snapshot"

# Generate, commit, and push to remote
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --git-commit --git-push

# Multiple data views with Git commits
cja_auto_sdr dv_prod dv_staging dv_dev --git-commit
```

**New Functions:**
- `is_git_repository()`: Check if a directory is a Git repository
- `git_get_user_info()`: Get Git user name and email
- `save_git_friendly_snapshot()`: Save snapshot in Git-friendly format
- `generate_git_commit_message()`: Generate descriptive commit messages

#### Compare With Previous Snapshot (New Feature)

**`--compare-with-prev`**: Automatically find and compare against the most recent snapshot for a data view.

Instead of manually specifying snapshot paths:
```bash
# Before: Required knowing the exact snapshot path
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --diff-snapshot ./snapshots/dv_12345_20260120_103045.json
```

Now you can simply:
```bash
# After: Automatically finds the most recent snapshot
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --compare-with-prev
```

**Features:**
- Searches `--snapshot-dir` (default: `./snapshots`) for snapshots matching the data view ID
- Automatically selects the most recent snapshot by timestamp
- Works with both data view IDs and names
- Combines seamlessly with other diff options (`--changes-only`, `--format`, etc.)

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Compare against most recent snapshot in default directory
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --compare-with-prev

# Compare against most recent snapshot in custom directory
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --compare-with-prev --snapshot-dir ./my_snapshots

# With other diff options
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --compare-with-prev --changes-only --format markdown
```

**New Method:**
- `SnapshotManager.get_most_recent_snapshot()`: Find the most recent snapshot for a specific data view in a directory

**5 New Tests** for `--compare-with-prev`:
- `test_compare_with_prev_flag_default`: Verifies default is False
- `test_compare_with_prev_flag_enabled`: Verifies flag can be enabled
- `test_compare_with_prev_with_snapshot_dir`: Verifies works with custom snapshot directory
- `test_get_most_recent_snapshot_returns_latest`: Verifies correct snapshot selection
- `test_get_most_recent_snapshot_filters_by_data_view`: Verifies filtering by data view ID

#### Diff Summary Totals

Enhanced diff output now includes total change counts across all component types for quick at-a-glance summaries.

**Console Output:**
```
================================================================================
Total: 4 added, 6 removed, 3 modified
  Metrics: 3 added, 2 removed, 1 modified
  Dimensions: 1 added, 4 removed, 2 modified
================================================================================
```

**New `DiffSummary` Properties:**
- `total_added`: Sum of metrics_added + dimensions_added
- `total_removed`: Sum of metrics_removed + dimensions_removed
- `total_modified`: Sum of metrics_modified + dimensions_modified
- `total_summary`: Human-readable string (e.g., "4 added, 6 removed, 3 modified")

**Updated Output Formats:**
- **Console**: Color-coded totals in footer (green for added, red for removed, yellow for modified)
- **Markdown**: Uses `total_summary` in summary section
- **JSON**: Includes `total_added`, `total_removed`, `total_modified`, `total_summary` fields

**9 New Tests** for diff summary totals:
- `test_total_added`: Verifies total_added calculation
- `test_total_removed`: Verifies total_removed calculation
- `test_total_modified`: Verifies total_modified calculation
- `test_total_summary_with_changes`: Verifies formatted summary string
- `test_total_summary_no_changes`: Verifies "No changes" output
- `test_total_summary_partial_changes`: Verifies only non-zero values shown

#### Performance Optimizations

**Vectorized Markdown Table Generation:**
- Replaced `DataFrame.iterrows()` with vectorized `DataFrame.apply()` for markdown table generation
- 2-5x faster markdown generation for large data views

**Excel Format Caching:**
- Added `ExcelFormatCache` class to reuse format objects across Excel sheets
- Reduces memory allocation overhead and improves Excel generation performance

**Lazy Logging in Hot Paths:**
- Added `logger.isEnabledFor()` checks before expensive log message construction in `ValidationCache` methods
- Reduces logging overhead in production mode

#### Diff Output Control

**`--group-by-field-limit N`**: Control the number of items shown per section in `--group-by-field` output.
- Default is 10 items per section
- Use `--group-by-field-limit 0` for unlimited (no truncation)
- Applies to CHANGES BY FIELD, ADDED, and REMOVED sections

```bash
# Show all items (no truncation)
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_12345 dv_67890 --group-by-field --group-by-field-limit 0

# Show first 25 items per section
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_12345 dv_67890 --group-by-field --group-by-field-limit 25
```

**6 New Tests** for `--group-by-field-limit`:
- `test_grouped_by_field_limit_default`: Verifies default limit of 10 truncates output
- `test_grouped_by_field_limit_zero_shows_all`: Verifies limit=0 shows all items
- `test_grouped_by_field_limit_custom`: Verifies custom limit values work correctly
- `test_grouped_by_field_limit_added_removed`: Verifies limit applies to ADDED/REMOVED sections
- `test_parse_group_by_field_limit_flag`: CLI argument parsing test
- `test_parse_group_by_field_limit_default`: CLI default value test

### Changed
- **Test Count**: 623 → 672 tests (+28 Git integration tests, +6 group-by-field-limit tests, +14 compare-with-prev and diff summary tests)
- **Documentation**: 14 → 15 guides (new Git Integration guide)

### Backward Compatibility
- **Full Backward Compatibility**: All existing commands continue to work unchanged
- **No Breaking Changes**: All 672 tests pass
- **New Features Optional**: Git integration and `--compare-with-prev` are opt-in via CLI flags

---

- **OutputWriter Protocol** - Standardized interface for output format writers
- **Expanded Test Coverage** - 623 total tests (+210 new: 139 diff comparison + 39 edge cases + 5 format validation + 27 UX features)

This release introduces the **Data View Diff Comparison** feature for change tracking and CI/CD integration, **Auto-Snapshot** for automatic audit trails, **UX Quick Wins** for better developer experience, plus **code maintainability** improvements (type hints, centralized configuration) and **developer experience** enhancements (better exceptions, standardized interfaces) while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### Added

#### Auto-Snapshot on Diff (New Feature)
Automatically save timestamped snapshots during diff comparisons—no extra commands needed.

- **`--auto-snapshot`**: Enable automatic snapshot saving during `--diff` or `--diff-snapshot` operations
- **`--snapshot-dir DIR`**: Directory for auto-saved snapshots (default: `./snapshots`)
- **`--keep-last N`**: Retention policy to keep only the last N snapshots per data view (0 = keep all)
- **Timestamped Filenames**: Snapshots saved with format `DataViewName_dv_id_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- **Audit Trail**: Every comparison automatically documents the "before" state
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Scheduled diffs build history automatically without manual intervention
- **Zero Friction**: Transparent operation—just add `--auto-snapshot` to existing commands

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Auto-save snapshots during diff comparison
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_A dv_B --auto-snapshot

# Custom snapshot directory
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_A dv_B --auto-snapshot --snapshot-dir ./history

# With retention policy (keep last 10 per data view)
cja_auto_sdr --diff dv_A dv_B --auto-snapshot --keep-last 10

# Works with diff-snapshot too (saves current state)
cja_auto_sdr dv_123 --diff-snapshot baseline.json --auto-snapshot
```

**New SnapshotManager Methods:**
- `generate_snapshot_filename()`: Creates timestamped, sanitized filenames
- `apply_retention_policy()`: Deletes old snapshots beyond retention limit

**16 New Tests** for auto-snapshot functionality:
- Filename generation (4 tests): with/without name, special chars, truncation
- Retention policy (5 tests): keep all, delete old, per-data-view, empty/nonexistent dirs
- CLI arguments (7 tests): defaults, custom values, all flags together

#### UX Quick Wins (Developer Experience)
Four new features to improve daily workflows and scripting integration.

##### Auto-Open Generated Files (`--open`)
Open generated SDR files automatically in the default application after creation.

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on macOS (`open`), Linux (`xdg-open`), and Windows (`os.startfile`)
- **Batch Mode Support**: Opens all successfully generated files when processing multiple data views
- **Graceful Fallback**: HTML files fall back to `webbrowser` module if system commands fail

```bash
# Generate SDR and open immediately
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --open

# Batch processing - opens all successful files
cja_auto_sdr dv_1 dv_2 dv_3 --open
```

##### Stdout Output for Piping (`--output -`)
Write JSON or CSV output directly to stdout for Unix-style piping and scripting.

- **`--output -`** or **`--output stdout`**: Write to standard output instead of a file
- **Implicit Quiet Mode**: Automatically suppresses decorative output when writing to stdout
- **Pipeline Friendly**: Enables `cja_auto_sdr ... | jq ...` workflows

```bash
# Pipe data view list to jq for processing
cja_auto_sdr --list-dataviews --output - | jq '.dataViews[].id'

# Get stats as JSON to stdout
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --stats --output -

# CSV output for spreadsheet import
cja_auto_sdr --list-dataviews --format csv --output - > dataviews.csv
```

##### Quick Statistics Mode (`--stats`)
Get quick metrics and dimension counts without generating full SDR reports.

- **Fast Overview**: Shows metrics count, dimensions count, and totals for each data view
- **Multiple Data Views**: Process multiple data views in one command with aggregated totals
- **Multiple Formats**: Table (default), JSON, or CSV output

### Fixed

#### Diff Comparison NaN Handling
- **False Positive Fix**: Components with identical null/NaN values no longer incorrectly flagged as "modified"
- **Proper NaN Detection**: Added `pd.isna()` check in value normalization to treat NaN same as null/empty
- **Clearer Display**: Empty/null/NaN values now display as `(empty)` instead of `nan` in diff output

#### Ambiguous Name Resolution in Diff Mode
- **Separate Resolution**: Source and target identifiers are now resolved independently for diff operations
- **Exact Match Validation**: Diff operations (`--diff`, `--snapshot`, `--diff-snapshot`) now require exactly one data view match per identifier
- Previously, both identifiers were combined and resolved together, which could lead to incorrect comparisons when data view names matched multiple entries

### Changed
- **DEFAULT_RETRY_CONFIG**: Now uses `DEFAULT_RETRY.to_dict()` for backward compatibility
- **Type Annotations**: Added to all writer functions, core processing functions, retry functions
- **Import Section**: Extended to include `TypeVar`, `Protocol`, `runtime_checkable`, `field`
- **Format Validation**: `--format console` now shows clear error for SDR generation (console is diff-only)

### Backward Compatibility
- **Full Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work unchanged
- **No Breaking Changes**: All 623 tests pass
- **DEFAULT_RETRY_CONFIG Dict**: Still available as a dict for legacy code
- **Configuration Migration**: Existing configurations work without changes

## [3.0.7] - 2026-01-11

### Added

#### Code Quality & Maintainability
- **Centralized Validation Schema (`VALIDATION_SCHEMA`)**: All field definitions consolidated into single module-level constant
  - `required_metric_fields`: Fields required for metrics validation
  - `required_dimension_fields`: Fields required for dimensions validation
  - `critical_fields`: Fields checked for null values
  - Single source of truth eliminates scattered field definitions
  - Easier to update validation rules across the codebase

- **Error Message Formatting Helper (`_format_error_msg`)**: Consistent error message formatting
  - Unified format: `"Error {operation} for {item_type}: {error}"`
  - Replaces 18 inconsistent inline error message formats
  - Easier to modify error format globally
  - Handles optional parameters gracefully

#### Performance Optimization
- **Cache Key Reuse Optimization**: Eliminates redundant DataFrame hashing
  - `ValidationCache.get()` now returns `(issues, cache_key)` tuple
  - `ValidationCache.put()` accepts optional `cache_key` parameter
  - Avoids rehashing same DataFrame on cache misses (5-10% faster)
  - Fully backward compatible - `cache_key` parameter is optional

#### Test Coverage Expansion
- **17 New Tests** added for new functionality:
  - Error message formatting tests (7 tests)
  - Validation schema tests (6 tests)
  - Cache key reuse optimization tests (4 tests)
- **Total test count**: 191 → 208 tests

### Changed
- `ValidationCache.get()` return type changed from `Optional[List[Dict]]` to `Tuple[Optional[List[Dict]], str]`
- Error logging calls throughout codebase now use `_format_error_msg()` helper
- Validation calls use `VALIDATION_SCHEMA` instead of inline field definitions

### Technical Details

**Cache Key Reuse Example:**
```python
# Before: DataFrame hashed twice on cache miss
result = cache.get(df, 'Metrics', required, critical)  # Hash 1
if result is None:
    # ... validation ...
    cache.put(df, 'Metrics', required, critical, issues)  # Hash 2

# After: Hash computed once, reused
result, cache_key = cache.get(df, 'Metrics', required, critical)  # Hash 1
if result is None:
    # ... validation ...
    cache.put(df, 'Metrics', required, critical, issues, cache_key)  # No rehash
```
