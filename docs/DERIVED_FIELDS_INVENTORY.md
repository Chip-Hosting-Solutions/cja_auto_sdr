# Derived Field Inventory

The CJA SDR Generator includes a derived field inventory feature that provides a summary of all derived fields within a Data View. This inventory surfaces derived field logic, complexity scores, and metadata, making SDR documentation reviews more efficient.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Include derived field inventory in SDR output
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-derived
```

This adds a "Derived Fields" sheet/section to your SDR output with details about each derived field.

## CLI Option

| Option              | Description                                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--include-derived` | Include derived field inventory in SDR output. Adds a "Derived Fields" sheet/section with complexity scores, functions used, and logic summaries |

## Output Columns

The derived field inventory includes the following information for each derived field:

| Column            | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| name              | Component name                                           |
| type              | Metric or Dimension                                      |
| id                | Full component identifier                                |
| description       | Component description (if available in data view)        |
| complexity_score  | 0-100 score indicating logic complexity                  |
| functions_used    | Human-readable list of functions (e.g., "Case When, Lowercase") |
| branch_count      | Number of branches for Case When logic                   |
| schema_fields     | Count of schema fields referenced                        |
| schema_field_list | List of referenced field IDs (truncated if many)         |
| lookup_references | External lookup/classify references                      |
| rule_names        | Metadata from the field definition (#rule_name values)   |
| logic_summary     | Brief description of what the field does                 |
| summary           | Alias for `logic_summary` (for cross-module consistency) |
| output_type       | Inferred output type (Numeric, String, Unknown)          |
| definition_json   | Raw `fieldDefinition` JSON for full fidelity             |

## Complexity Score

The complexity score (0-100) helps identify derived fields that may need review or simplification. It's calculated from weighted factors:

| Factor         | Weight | Max Value | Description                     |
|----------------|--------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Operators      | 30%    | 200       | Total operators in predicates   |
| Branches       | 25%    | 50        | Case When branch count          |
| Nesting        | 20%    | 5         | Nesting depth of conditions     |
| Functions      | 10%    | 20        | Number of unique functions used |
| Schema fields  | 10%    | 10        | Number of schema fields referenced |
| Regex patterns | 5%     | 5         | Number of regex patterns        |

**Score interpretation:**
- **0-25**: Simple derived field
- **25-50**: Moderate complexity
- **50-75**: Elevated complexity - consider review
- **75-100**: High complexity - may benefit from simplification

## Logic Summary

The logic summary provides a detailed human-readable description of what each derived field does, including actual conditions, values, and field names:

### Case When Fields
Shows example condition→value pairs and default values:
- `'Case When: channel="email"→"Email"; channel="paid"→"Paid"; ..., else: "Other"'`
- `'Case When (12): eVar1 contains "promo"→"Promotion"; eVar1 starts "aff"→"Affiliate"; ...'`

### Lookup Fields
Shows the key-to-value mapping and dataset:
- `'Lookup: productId → productName from products_lookup'`
- `'Lookup by sku'`

### Math Operations
Shows the actual formula with field names:
- `'Math: revenue / sessions'`
- `'Math: unitPrice × quantity'`

### URL Parsing
Shows which component is extracted and from which field:
- `'URL parse: extract hostname from pageURL'`
- `'URL parse: extract query param "campaign" from referrer'`

### String Operations

- `'Combines 4 fields'`

## Output Formats

The derived field inventory is included in all SDR output formats when `--include-derived` is specified:

### Excel
Adds a "Derived Fields" sheet to the SDR workbook, sorted by complexity score (highest first).

**Sheet Order:**
1. Metadata
2. Data Quality
3. DataView
4. Metrics
5. Dimensions
6. Derived Fields (if `--include-derived`)
7. Calculated Metrics (if `--include-calculated`)

> **Note:** Inventory sheets appear at the end in CLI argument order. Use `--include-calculated --include-derived` to place Calculated Metrics before Derived Fields.

### JSON
Adds a `derived_fields` section to the output:

### Complexity Review
Sort by complexity score to identify derived fields that may need:
- Simplification
- Splitting into multiple fields
- Migration to lookup datasets

### Function Audit
The function usage summary helps identify:
- Which functions are most commonly used
- Potential opportunities for standardization

### Logic Documentation
Rule names and logic summaries provide documentation for derived field configurations.

## CJA Function Reference

## Snapshot Diff Support

> **Important:** The derived fields inventory is for **SDR generation only**—it is NOT included in snapshot diff comparisons.
>
> **Why?** Derived fields are already included in the standard CJA metrics and dimensions API outputs. When you compare snapshots or data views, derived field changes are automatically captured in the **Metrics/Dimensions diff sections**. Including them again in a separate inventory diff would produce duplicate output.

### How Derived Field Changes Are Tracked

Derived field changes are tracked through the standard Metrics/Dimensions diff:

- **Standard diff**: compares `name`, `title`, `description`, `type`, `schemaPath`
- **Extended diff** (`--extended-fields`): adds `hidden`, `format`, `precision`, `attribution`, `persistence`, `bucketing`, `derivedFieldId`, etc.

### Example: Tracking Derived Field Changes

```bash
# Create baseline snapshot (derived fields are captured automatically)
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --snapshot ./baseline.json

# Later, compare against baseline
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --diff-snapshot ./baseline.json

# Derived field changes appear in METRICS CHANGES or DIMENSIONS CHANGES:
# [+] dv_12345/derived/new_channel    "New Marketing Channel"
# [~] dv_12345/derived/channel        description: 'Old desc' -> 'New desc'
```

### SDR-Only Usage

Use `--include-derived` to add logic analysis to your SDR output:

```bash
# Include derived fields inventory in SDR
cja_auto_sdr dv_12345 --include-derived

# The inventory provides complexity scores, function usage, and logic summaries
# that help document your derived field implementations
```

### Inventory Diff Alternatives

For snapshot diff comparisons, use these inventory options instead:

| Inventory | Diff Support | Why |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| `--include-segments` | ✅ Yes | Segments are separate components not in standard Metrics/Dimensions |
| `--include-calculated` | ✅ Yes | Calculated metrics are separate components not in standard Metrics/Dimensions |
| `--include-derived` | ❌ SDR only | Derived fields are already in standard Metrics/Dimensions |

See [Diff Comparison Guide](DIFF_COMPARISON.md#inventory-diff-snapshot-only) for complete documentation on inventory diff support.

## Limitations

- **Per-data-view only**: The inventory is generated per data view, not across multiple data views
- **Snapshot in time**: The inventory reflects the data view state at generation time
- **No real-time updates**: Re-run SDR generation to capture changes
- **Diff scope**: Inventory diff only works for same-data-view snapshot comparisons

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not import derived field inventory"

The inventory module is not available. Ensure you have the latest version:

```bash
uv pip install --upgrade cja-auto-sdr
```

### No derived fields found

The inventory only includes fields where:
- `sourceFieldType = "derived"`
- A valid `fieldDefinition` JSON array exists

Standard and custom fields are not included.

### Empty inventory

If your data view has no derived fields, the inventory section will be empty but still present in the output.
